The African National Congress44, Commissioner StreetJohannesburgJune 9, 1953Mr. Paul RobesonChairman,Council on African Affairs, Inc.53 West 125th Street,New York 27, N.Y.Dear Friend,The African National Congress highly appreciates the good work and tireless efforts made by your Council in educating our American Negro Brothers and the public of America as a whole.We also express our gratitude for the assistance you have given us in our Campaign for the Defiance of Unjust Laws. The continuation of this valuable work has become more important in these days in view of the powerful propaganda waged by the South African Government in an attempt to discredit the liberatory movement by branding it subversive and anti-White.It is not accidental that your organization has become the victim of the reactionary Eisenhower-McCarthy ruling clique who are conniving with other imperialists for the oppression and exploitation of millions of colonial and semi-colonial peoples. We are, however, confident that the progressive forces the world over, united as they are in their determination to expose and end oppression and domination of one group by another, will triumph for their cause is just.Yours in the cause for Freedom,(sd) W.M. SisuluSecretary-General
